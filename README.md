## purpose
****
jSequencr is a sequencer/drum machine web app designed by Grails DB for General Assemb.ly's Web Development Immersive group project in March 2014. It utilizes the experimental HTML5 Web Audio API, and so is completely Flash-free. Users can compose beats and save them to their library of songs.

This is the second project for [General Assembly's Web Development Immersive](https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive), week 10 of a 12 week programming intensive that takes people with no programming experience and turns them into full-stack web developers. This is the first group project.


## technologies 
****
* ruby 2.1.0 & Rails 4.0.3
* HTML5 Web Audio API
* Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3
* jQuery UI
* Mousetrap

Note: Web Audio API is not supported by IE. 


#### Amazon Web Services S3
****
Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) was used to store the wav files that make up our drum and other sound samples. 

#### jQuery UI
****
jQuery UI is a curated set of user interface interactions, effects, widgets, and themes built on top of the jQuery JavaScript Library. 

#### Web Audio API
****
This API facillitates buffering audio sources, playback of those buffers, and a number of other audio manipulations. Much thanks to [Boris Smus](https://github.com/borismus) for his [awesome Web Audio tutorial](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webaudio/intro/).  


#### Mousetrap
****
[Mousetrap](http://craig.is/killing/mice) is a simple library for handling keyboard shortcuts in Javascript.
